##KNN 
Idea/Orginal Source : http://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-to-implement-k-nearest-neighbors-in-python-from-scratch/
the orginal code only uses euclidian distance, modifications were made to include manhattan distance and cosine similiarity
pass the number of neighbors as an argument
```python
python knn.py 10
```
